# 👋 Hi, I’m @Lrigami

I'm a junior web developer who started dev in October 2024. I mainly develop with Angular, Symfony and NestJS. 
At the moment I'm developing a website for a boarding game shop using Symfony and Angular. 
I'm passionate about Japan, where I lived for 6 months. Another of my projects currently in the pre-development phase is a website for learning Japanese from French at intermediate to advanced levels. 
If you're interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prune-thiry-6886a6136/). You can contact me in French, English or Japanese.  

See you soon!
